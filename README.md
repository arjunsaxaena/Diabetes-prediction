# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project is focused on predicting diabetes using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model
that can accurately classify whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on various medical attributes. Additionally, this project
incorporates Explainable AI using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) module to interpret the model's predictions. The project also 
includes data visualization to gain insights from the dataset.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the diabetes dataset for training the model.

Data Visualization: Various visualizations, such as histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps, were created to explore and understand
the data.

Model Training: Implemented several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a Deep Learning model using
TensorFlow/Keras.

Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess model performance.

Explainable AI: Used SHAP to provide explanations for model predictions, making the model's decision process transparent and interpretable.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.

# Explainability with SHAP 

SHAP is used to explain the output of machine learning models. It provides insights into which features are most important in predicting
diabetes for individual patients. Visualizations such as SHAP summary plots is generated to enhance interpretability.
